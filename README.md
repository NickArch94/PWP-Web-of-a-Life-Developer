# PWP-Web-of-a-Life-Developer

## Intent
This is my CNM Deep Dive Fullstack Web Development - Personal Website Project titled "Web of a Life Developer."
My intention with this project is to showcase the work I have done in Web Development, 
as well as in other media projects. I also plan on showcasing my journey through my diagnosis
of Multiple Sclerosis, and how I have been dealing with it on a mental, physical, and emotional level.

## Expectation
I plan to use this static webpage to offer my experience and perspective in dealing with major life
challenges. With this, I hope to potentially help others going through similar experiences to feel supported and
heard. I also plan on providing appropriate resources to help visitors find support in dealing with 
similar health struggles and career changes.
